## `Description`

#### It's very simple, go to the "Search" section and you can search for movies by title. Come on, It is a piece of cake. This is a test of the first use of ReactJS. In this example the basic hooks (useState and useEffect) have been implemented. As a source of information the API of movies and series [omdbapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) was used.
